# Bus-Booking-Service
Program showing available trips from 3 vendors, allowing bookings to be made
Consider we want to start a service like "expedia.com". We will call it "travelireland.com",
where we are responsible for displaying the available bus trips from various bus service
companies and to place an order from travellers/customers.
Letâ€™s keep our service as simple as,
1) Displaying bus-trips (startingLocation, destination, dateOfDeparture,
timeOfDeparture, dateOfArrival, timeOfArrival, fare) available from vendors like
"GoBus", "Bus-Eireann" and "City-Link".
2) Place an order for one or more seats to a respective bus-vendor. (noOfPassengers,
startingLocation, destination, dateOfDeparture, timeOfDeparture, dateOfArrival,
timeOfArrival, fare).

You can view all availabe trips from each of the three vendors.
Book a number of seats and this information will be reflected in subsequent calls to viewing all trips
You will not be able to book a number of seats in excess of the seats avalible
